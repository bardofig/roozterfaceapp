I. Key Gamefowl Breeds and Their Characteristics
• Gallo Malayo (Malay Rooster)
    ◦ Aggressiveness & Fighting Style: Leads in aggressiveness and fighting capabilities. These birds are fast, furious, and lethal, fighting with expert aim to kill and not stopping until their opponent ceases to move. They embody a ferocity believed to have been preserved from their dinosaur ancestors.
    ◦ Physical Characteristics: Stands approximately 70 centimeters (about 27.5 inches) tall, earning them the title of "tallest rooster breed". They are powerful birds with long necks, intense eyes, bent beaks, cherry combs, small wattles, firm, tight plumage, and short tails. Their physical attributes show an influence on the Peruvian Navaja breed.
    ◦ History: Believed to have existed for at least 3,000 years. They are considered one of the primitive fighting rooster breeds.
• Gallo Sweater (Sweater Rooster)
    ◦ Origin: Developed by Carol Nesmith, a well-known breeder of gamefowl for cockfights in Mexico and the Philippines. This breed was developed as a response to other strong competitors.
    ◦ Physical Characteristics: Typically weighs between 3 and 5 pounds, with long (though not tall) bodies and medium-sized, slightly curled tails. They resemble Hatch, Kelso, and Radio gamefowl.
    ◦ Fighting Style: Excels in agility and speed. Despite being underestimated due to their size, Sweater roosters are fearless and can defeat much larger opponents by leveraging their size to their advantage.
    ◦ Breeding Notes: The Sweater is a very popular and common breed, highly sought after due to its ease of crossing with most other lines (Hatch, Kelso, Radio, Albany, Brown Red, Asiles, Butchers, Clarets, Roundhead). They are known for their strong ability to transmit their genes effectively ("prepotencia") and their adaptability to various climates. Some sources suggest the Sweater line originated from crosses between Yellow-legged Hatch and Kelso.
• Gallo Old English Game (Old English Game Rooster)
    ◦ Origin: A traditional British breed that has existed for many years. After cockfighting was banned in the UK in the 1950s, their purpose shifted from fighting to exhibition. This breed was introduced to Peru in the early 20th century.
    ◦ Physical Characteristics: Considered beautiful, they come in many recognized colors including black-breasted red, black-breasted brassy, blue-gold duckwing, Columbian, Cuckoo, blue lemon, spangled, and wheaten. They stand tall with puffed chests, long necks, bright feathers, and curved beaks. Their legs are short, sturdy, and marked by four curved claws.
    ◦ Temperament: Known for being high-maintenance and noisy, possessing a lot of personality.
    ◦ Fighting Style: Despite their smaller size, they are strong fighters with considerable attitude. They contribute speed, power, and vehemence to crosses.
• Gallo Kelso (Kelso Rooster)
    ◦ Importance: Regarded as one of the most important and classic gamecock breeds, commonly found in cockfighting venues. They are particularly effective at attacking.
    ◦ Origin: The breed's history is linked to Walter A. Kelso of Oleander Gamefarm, originally a derivative of the American Gamefowl. Biboy Enriquez of Firebird Gamefarm is known for producing strong and aggressive Kelsos by blending their bloodlines with Lemon, Sweater, Hatch, and Roundheads. Their foundational bloodlines include Murphy, Albany, McClanahan, and Claret.
    ◦ Physical Characteristics: Aesthetically appealing, they are large birds typically weighing between 6 and 8 pounds. They have impressive plumage, iridescent tail feathers, and an elegant head that gives them an intelligent appearance. Their bright colors make them excellent for exhibitions.
    ◦ Fighting Style: While not always the strongest or fastest, Kelsos are renowned for their strategic "in-and-out" fighting tactic, where they feint before delivering a decisive blow. They are skilled at engaging opponents and rarely allow them to escape once in range.
    ◦ Breeding Notes: Kelso lines are highly successful in crosses such as Kelso Hatch, Kelso Sweater, Kelso Radio, Kelso Giros, and Kelso Asil.
• Gallo American Gamefowl / Roundhead
    ◦ Versatility: These birds are versatile, suitable for various purposes, including shows due to their spectacular appearance.
    ◦ Temperament: They are known for being extremely aggressive, to the point where they are called "deer" (ciervos) and must be kept separate from their flocks until maturity to prevent conflict. Even the hens can be belligerent.
    ◦ Physical Characteristics: They feature red five-pointed combs, small red wattles and earlobes, and yellow eyes. They have long beaks and capable, long bodies, utilizing their agility to their advantage. Roundheads also possess long sickle feathers and are available in many colors, including black, red, blue-red, brown-red, blue, silver, white, and gold.
    ◦ Fighting Style: Highly territorial with exceptional fighting and survival skills. They fight relentlessly until victory, characterized by jumping, flying, and constant activity during combat.
    ◦ Breeding Notes: The Roundhead is commonly used in crosses, notably with Hatch and Kelso lines.
• Gallo Asil (Asil Rooster)
    ◦ Origin & Physical Characteristics: Originating in Asia, Asils have a distinct, almost prehistoric appearance, tending to be taller and more slender than Bankivoides. Any rooster line that produces pea combs likely has Oriental blood, a characteristic common in Malays and other Oriental breeds.
    ◦ Fighting Style & Attributes: Asils contribute fortitude, resistance to fatigue and disease, intelligence, power, increased musculature, and precise cutting ability. They are known for their natural resistance to many diseases, making them easier to raise.
    ◦ Types & Usage: Two main categories exist: those fought with wrapped spurs and those with steel weapons. The latter, bred to weigh between 4 and 5.5 pounds, are specifically selected for steel weapon combat and are valuable for crossing with North American gamefowl lines. Many modern North American lines incorporate Asil (Oriental) blood, such as the Allen Roundheads.
    ◦ Breeding Notes: Asil blood is often introduced in successful crosses to impart desirable traits, including with Sweater, Hatch, Giros, and Brown Red lines, often in 50/50 or 75/25 proportions.
• Gallo Shamo (Japanese Shamo)
    ◦ Classification: In Japan, any pure fighting rooster is called "Shamo," regardless of size or weight, with the name likely derived from "Siam".
    ◦ Varieties & Physical Characteristics: Another variety, "Ainoku," are large combat roosters (5-7 kg), similar to Malay roosters, though not considered true fighting birds by Japanese standards. A third group, "Tuzos" or "Sekis," are smaller (1.5-2.0 kg), less lanky, with black, tight, strong plumage, and curved spurs. Tuzos have a rougher head, sunken eyes, prominent cheeks, and a characteristic black tongue indicating purity.
    ◦ Fighting Style: Tuzos are described as among the best and finest fighters, aiming for the opponent's head or any vulnerable part. Shamos are generally favored for their resilience, stamina, and fighting instinct.
• Gallo a Navaja del Perú (Peruvian Navaja Gamecock)
    ◦ Status & Recognition: While not yet standardized as a definitive breed with stable genetic characteristics, it serves as a pattern for Peruvian navaja fighting. It is globally recognized for its unique "covered rooster" style ("gallos de tapada").
    ◦ General Characteristics: Medium to large in size, slender, and very upright in posture, especially when alert. They are muscular with a raptor-like head and an incisive, penetrating gaze. They mature fully around 18 months of age. Their aggressive, provocative, and arrogant demeanor defines their "hot-blooded" style, as they cannot tolerate another rooster nearby.
    ◦ Varieties: Recognized varieties based on comb type include simple comb, rose comb, and triple comb, which can appear in any color.
    ◦ Physical Features:
        ▪ Weight: Roosters typically weigh 8.5-10.5 lbs (3.8-4.7 kg); hens, 6-7 lbs (2.7-3.1 kg).
        ▪ Height: Roosters 50-60 cm (19.7-23.6 in); hens 45-50 cm (17.7-19.7 in).
        ▪ Head: Strong, medium to large, often with prominent cheekbones (influenced by Malay blood) and sometimes prominent eyebrows. Their face is slightly rough due to Asian blood.
        ▪ Beak: Strong, medium to long, slightly curved for a powerful bite, though modern breeding sometimes favors a longer beak to maintain distance.
        ▪ Eyes: Large, expressive, and always alert, ranging in color from light yellow to black, including shades of orange, red, and brown.
        ▪ Neck: Long, strong at the base, and slightly arched.
        ▪ Body: Wide shoulders, muscular trunk, with a back sloping towards the tail. The chest is broad and round, with some having a flat and prominent keel.
        ▪ Tail: Medium to long, whip-shaped (Malay/Asil influence) or sickle/saber-shaped (English influence), with an angle between 40° and 60°.
        ▪ Legs & Feet: Muscular, rounded legs with strong thighs. Shanks are medium to long, often square, and featherless. Toes are long, straight, and well-separated, with four per foot, allowing for a strong start.
    ◦ Weaponry: They traditionally use a double-edged steel "olive leaf" shaped blade, usually 7 to 8 cm long, attached to the left leg.
    ◦ Historical Context: This type of rooster emerged between the 18th and 19th centuries in Lima, Peru, and was developed as a distinct style from the lighter "pico" roosters, adapting to larger and heavier birds. The "Hoja de Olivo" navaja was officially adopted in 1930. Raising them is considered a pursuit for the wealthy due to the extensive time and resources required.
• Gallo Combatiente Español (Spanish Gamefowl)
    ◦ Contribution: Known for contributing courage, accuracy ("puntería"), and flight ability to crosses.
    ◦ Lines: Includes lines such as Canaria, Almodovar, and Perez Tabernero. Often referred to as "Trifino".
• Gallo Sumatra
    ◦ Contribution: Contributes "capeo" (evasion), "juego" (game), and "vista" (sight).
• Claret
    ◦ Bloodlines: Descended from a considerable amount of Earl of Derby, Genet Pyle, Deans Grey, and Mahoney blood.
    ◦ Breeding Notes: A key bloodline used in the foundation of Kelsos. Some Hatch lines also contained Claret blood. Clarets combined with Albanys produced the Yankee Clippers. Used in Giros de Cooke, Giros Cactus, Cardenales (Hatch-Claret with Murphy/Whitehackle), Oleanders, and Tool Pushers. Known for making excellent fighters.
• Hatch (including Yellow-legged Hatch)
    ◦ Origin: Said to have originated from black-red birds, and incorporated various bloodlines like Kearney Whitehackle, Kearney Brownred, Duryea, Jim Thompson, and Claret. Different Hatch lines were developed in various breeding farms.
    ◦ Importance: Consistently ranked among the top ten gamefowl lines. The Yellow-legged Hatch, also known as Jero Led Hatch, was a very important line.
    ◦ Fighting Style: Known for their agility and sharp reflexes.
    ◦ Breeding Notes: Highly successful in crosses such as Hatch Sweater, Hatch Roundhead, Hatch Albany, Hatch Giro, Hatch Radio, and Hatch Asil. The cross between Yellow-legged Hatch and Kelso is credited with the formation of the Sweater line.
• Giros
    ◦ Varieties: Includes Clemon, Regular Grey, Perfection Grey, and Madigan Giros.
    ◦ Breeding Notes: Excellent for crossing with Brown Red, Hatch, Sweater, Kelso, Albany, Radio, and Asil, often in 50/50 or 75/25 proportions.
• Brown Red
    ◦ Physical Characteristics: Popularly recognized by their feather color and characteristic dark legs.
    ◦ Breeding Notes: They cross well with Hatch (all varieties), Kelso, Albanys, Radios, Giros, and Asil, often in 50/50 or 75/25 proportions.
• Albanys
    ◦ Origin: Originally from Ireland.
    ◦ Physical Characteristics: Characterized by their reddish plumage, yellow legs, and sometimes a pea comb.
    ◦ Breeding Notes: They are excellent for crossing with Giros, Sweater, Kelso, Brown Red, Radio, and Butcher lines. Notably, crosses with Butcher led to the famous Brass Backs (Butcher Brass Back and Albany Brass Back).
II. General Concepts and Important Terms
• Casta (Game/Lineage): Refers to a rooster's inherent quality of combativeness and bravery. It's the ability of a bird to draw strength, power, and courage as it gets more injured, persevering in combat without giving up, even against fully healthy opponents. It is considered paramount, as a rooster without "casta" will yield and abandon the fight.
• Corte (Cutting Ability): Refers to the lethal cutting ability of a gamecock, inflicting clean and noble wounds on the opponent. The ability to cut well is crucial for winning fights.
• Línea (Line): A closed population of animals derived from specific matings within a family, often smaller than a "strain" and selected for particular morphology or attitude.
• Estirpe (Strain): A closed population of animals within a specific breed, reproduced without introducing outside material and subjected to particular selective pressures to develop distinct peculiarities. A strain has consistent physical characteristics and recognizable traits, with the ability to reproduce themselves.
• Raza (Breed): A group of individuals bred under similar conditions that are fertile among themselves and produce offspring identical to their parents across generations without alteration.
• Fenotipo (Phenotype): The observable physical characteristics of a rooster, including its skeleton, muscle mass, plumage, combs, and wattles.
• Estilo de Pleito (Fighting Style): A combination of the rooster's mental disposition and functional actions, aligned with its physical structure and proportions, to utilize all possible resources to defeat its rival.
• In-breeding: The mating of closely related birds (e.g., brother to sister, parent to offspring) to concentrate and fix desired genes or traits. While effective, it can increase the risk of negative traits and reduce fertility or increase disease susceptibility if not done by experts.
• Line-breeding: A type of in-breeding that involves breeding within the same line, often to an individual (e.g., father-granddaughter, half-siblings, uncle-niece) to reinforce desirable characteristics without as many risks as intensive in-breeding. It aims to produce individuals genetically similar to the original high-quality bird.
• Out-breeding: Mating roosters of the same strain but from different breeders, which helps to eliminate recessive homozygous characteristics.
• Cross-breeding: Mating roosters of different breeds. This is typically done to combine desirable qualities from different bloodlines. While pure breeds are often results of such crosses over time, it takes many generations (around 15) to establish a new recognized breed. The main purpose of out-crossing is to achieve hybrid vigor.
• Hybrid Vigor (Heterosis): The result of out-crossing, producing an individual that is better, faster, stronger, smarter, and more game than its parents.
II. Traits for Breeding Selection
When selecting roosters and hens for breeding, several characteristics are paramount:
• Fineza (Valor): An unyielding determination to defeat the opponent.
• Prepotencia (Prepotency): The ability to effectively transmit desirable traits to offspring.
• Salud (Health): Vigor, robustness, good appetite, and consistent aggressiveness.
• Fuerza (Strength): The necessary power to utilize weapons and inflict damage.
• Habilidad de Cortar (Cutting Ability): The crucial ability to inflict lethal cuts, as fights are won by effective cutters.
• Good Balance: A balanced rooster will fight better regardless of style.
• Physical Appearance: Includes a small head, bright and fierce red eyes, long and well-proportioned neck, football-shaped body, and strong keel bone. Tailbone feathers should be at a 45-degree angle.

Roosters, particularly those bred for cockfighting, exhibit a variety of comb types and plumage colors, often specifically chosen for their aesthetic appeal and perceived fighting prowess.
Types of Combs (Crestas)
The comb, or "cresta" in Spanish, is a prominent fleshy growth on the top of a rooster's head. Several distinct types are recognized:
• Simple (Single Comb): This is a common type, described as having a small or medium size. It is seen in varieties like the Minorca and is one of the main comb types for the Peruvian Navaja rooster. The Tuzo also has a small simple comb.
• Rosa (Rose Comb): Another recognized type, found in varieties like the Minorca and the Peruvian Navaja.
• Triple (Pea Comb): This type is characteristic of the Peruvian Navaja rooster.
• Cereza (Cherry Comb): This specific comb type is a characteristic of the Malay rooster.
• De Cinco Puntas (Five-pointed Comb): This is a feature of the American Gamefowl, also known as the Roundhead.
• Pava Comb: Often seen in Albanys and some Butcher/Albany crosses.
• Sierra Comb: Characterized by a serrated edge, it is found in Clarets and is occasionally seen in Albanys.
• Doble (Double Comb): Also referred to as "Abosado".
• Penacho (Tassel): A feathered crest on the head, found in some varieties of Old English Game roosters.
• Barba (Muffed): Refers to feathers forming a beard-like growth, also seen in some Old English Game varieties.
Some roosters undergo a procedure called "descreste" (dubbing), where their combs and wattles are amputated. This can be done from a young age (around 7-8 months for Peruvian Navaja roosters), often in the afternoon during a waning moon to minimize bleeding. A healthy and colorful comb is often an indicator of good health in a rooster, while changes in its appearance can signal disease. The comb also plays roles in temperature regulation, sexual attraction, protection against infections, and social interactions.
Colors of Plumage and Other Physical Features
Roosters come in a dazzling array of colors and patterns, contributing to their perceived beauty.
• Old English Game: This breed boasts a wide range of recognized colors, including black-breasted red, black-brassy black, blue-gold duckwing, Columbian, cuckoo, blue lemon, spangled, and wheaten, among others.
• Kelso: Known for its impressive and iridescent plumage, displaying bright colors. They can be found in reddish, lemon, yellow, and even pinto variations.
• American Gamefowl / Roundhead: These roosters are available in numerous colors such as black, red, blue-red, brown-red, blue, silver, white, and gold. They typically have red combs and wattles, and yellow eyes.
• Peruvian Navaja Rooster: Can be found in any color. Their eyes can range from light yellow to black, including orange, red, and brown shades. Their earlobes are usually red but can also be white, pink, blue, or yellow. The color of their legs and toes varies widely, including yellow, white, pink, sky blue, green, grey, blue, or black. Their skin can be white, yellow, or black. Their tail can be long and whip-like, or curved like a sickle.
• Tuzo: This breed is primarily characterized by its totally black plumage with green reflections. Their tarsus, spurs, beak, tongue, and palate can also be black, though some may have red-tinged feathers on their hackle and saddle.
• Shamo: Their plumage commonly appears in black, red, and occasionally white, with eyes typically having a pearl or very light yellow iris.
• Brown Red: This line is well-known for its dark plumage and leg coloration.
• Albanys: Distinguished by their reddish plumage and yellow legs, often with some white feathers mixed in their hackle.
• Giros (Greys): This category includes varieties like Lemon (Clemon), Regular Grey, Perfection Grey, and Madigan, and can also be found as silver-grey or honey-colored giros.
• Clarets: Described as roosters with red plumage, black chests, and black tails without any white, white legs, and sierra combs. They represent a pure English bloodline.
• Sid Taylor: This variety is known for its absolute black color.
• Butcher Brass Back and Albany Brass Back: These crosses resulted in roosters with reddish plumage, silver backs, and white legs, with either pea or sierra combs.
These diverse physical traits contribute to the unique appearance and identification of various rooster breeds and lines involved in the tradition of cockfighting.
